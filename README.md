# PolygonMap

An algorithm that uses the rapidXML library to load in a KML file containing the outlines of counties located in FL onto memory. Then using the data collected it calculates the geographic extents for each county (that is, the rectangle that completely encloses the county on all sides) and outputs this back in KML format.
